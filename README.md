OpenStateStats
==============

Computes total bills passed by legislators for OpenStates.org data.

This is posted here as an example for discussion. It depends on openstates4j (on github).

The goals are to:

To simplify the programming interface.
To repeat for all 50 states.
To incorporate the rest of the determinants needed to perform meaningful statistical analysis.
